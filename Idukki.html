          <p class="card-text"> The second highest peak in South India, Meesapulimala is an ideal spot for trekking. The starting point of the trek is either Rhodovalley or Silent Valley. After trekking for about 8 km from Rhodovalley, one gets to witness the grasslands, wildlife, rainforests, and small waterfalls.The beauty of the mountain range can only be fully appreciated if you trek to the top of the mountain. To that end, first, you have to take a jeep to the base camp and then hike to the top of the mountain. However, this route should only be undertaken by veteran hiking enthusiasts, as it can be quite grueling. </a>
